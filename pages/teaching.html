<p>
At <a href="http://www.ggc.edu/">Georgia Gwinnett College,</a> I usually teach algorithms/data structures (ITEC 3150), software development (ITEC 3860) and programming (ITEC 2120,
2150). I also enjoy teaching programming with an emphasis on developing video games. My students and I are currently creating an
Android app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.ggc.it">GGC-Connect,</a> which is an app
for the GGC community.
